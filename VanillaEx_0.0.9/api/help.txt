The API Emulator acts similar to a player. It makes the ticks go foward, and can spawn fake entities. Its main function is to make something happen.

The Gamehandler is trying to create an fake Factorio API, which the mod code can use. 
When the mod requests for example player.force, it will do so from gamehandler.lua, instead of the game.

Different print titles:

APIEmu is a print from the API itself, when it creates a player, spawns entities etc.
VanillaEx is a print from the Mod to the console, which would appear in real situations.
Debug is a print from the Mod code, it is what the mod is doing in reaction to events caused by the APIEmu/Player, this is normally unseen, and is useful in debugging.
